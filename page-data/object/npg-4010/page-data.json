The orange UV colour evident on the white lace and dress is typical of the presence of lead white. A bright yellow fluorescence if documented on the neck pendant, possibly due to the use of modern pigments. \n\nThe blue and green colours appear dark in the NIR image, suggesting the use of copper-based pigments.\n\nThe x-ray image highlights the lead-based materials used to paint white areas, such as the lace and pearls. The flesh tones appears opaque, suggesting that only a small amount of lead white was used.\n\nA few details, such as earrings, neck pendant and white detailing on the dress, appear in high relief in the raking light image, indicating a possible later addition. This is confirmed by MA-XRF maps, as barium is identified in those areas.","monogram":null,"dimensions_unframed_width":"~ 50","dimensions_unframed_height":"~ 64","pigments_background":"Red organic dye (insect-based), zinc white (retouching)","pigments_costume":"Costume: lead white; pink ribbons: red lead, red organic dye; blue ribbons: azurite, lead tin yellow, lead white; ruff: lead white, carbon black, red organic dye","pigments_flesh_tones_and_lips":"Flesh tones: lead white, chalk, red lead; lips: red lead, red lake","pigments_hair_and_beard":"Earth pigment, lead white, lead tin yellow, chalk, carbon black, barium white (retouching); headdress: pink ornaments: red lead, red organic dye; green ornaments: brochantite; green leaves: copper-based green, yellow organic dye(?)","pigments_jewellery":"Gold; silver; 'S' jewels: silver, lead white, barium white (retouching), cobalt blue (retouching); green pendant: lead white, barium white (retouching), emerald green(?)
