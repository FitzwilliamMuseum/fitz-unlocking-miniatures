These areas appear white, while in contrast, the lead white used to paint flesh tones and pearls appears darkened. \nThe UV image shows a large retouching on the flesh tones, appearing bright due to the use of zinc white, and other localised ones on the background and pearls. The pale orange UV fluorescence evident on the embroidered clothing, the pearls and the veil, is due to the use of lead white. The pinkish UV fluorescence on the red toga and lips is due to the red organic dyes, while the red UV fluorescence on the blue garment is due to the calomel.\nThe blue garment is made of azurite, although ultramarine blue is also likely present: the NIR image shows a moderate shade of grey in contrast to the very dark typically detected from azurite alone.","monogram":true,"dimensions_unframed_width":"42","dimensions_unframed_height":"52","pigments_background":"Bone black, indigo, earth pigments, lead white","pigments_costume":"Red toga: red lake; blue garb: azurite, ultramarine(?), calomel/mercury white","pigments_flesh_tones_and_lips":"Flesh tones: lead white, red lead(?), zinc white (retouching)","pigments_hair_and_beard":"Earth pigments, bone black, lead-based pigment","pigments_jewellery":"Gold; silver","materials_supports":"Vellum on card","analytical_techniques_used":["FORS","XRF","FT-IR"],"exhibitions":[{"id":"100","exhibitions_id":{"id":"31","name":"Seventeenth Century Art in Europe","start_date":"1938","end_date":"1938","url":"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/exhibition-catalogue/1938-exhibition-of-seventeenth-century-art-in-europe"}},{"id":"101","exhibitions_id":{"id":"13","name":"Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver.
