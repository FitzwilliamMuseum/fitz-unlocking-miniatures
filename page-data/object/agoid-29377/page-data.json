Lips contain vermilion, which is usually not identified after 1610.\nThe yellow lace is unusual, however not in itself an argument against an attribution to Oliver. It is however notable, on comparison, that the quality (in terms of the consistency and precision of the paint handling) of the execution of the lace in AGOID.29377 is less accomplished than other examples more securely attributed to Oliver.","monogram":true,"dimensions_unframed_width":"41","dimensions_unframed_height":"51","pigments_background":"Azurite (retouched with zinc white, cobalt blue,
