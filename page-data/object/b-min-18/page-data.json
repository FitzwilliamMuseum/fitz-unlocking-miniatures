The heavy dark outlines of the hair-ornaments, the cursory yet informative setting out of the dress features, and the lack of modelling to the face, may indicate the latter, as finished miniatures would not typically feature the relatively heavy-handed daubs and black outlining at the early stages of execution, since these would be difficult to disguise later on in the painting process using gum-bound pigments on vellum. \n\nIt has been embellished at a later point, in particular with reinforcements to the figure-of-eight lines of the collar drawn up with zinc white, pointing to a C19th or C20th intervention.","description_physical":"The UV image shows pink UV fluorescence in the background, corresponding to the use of a red organic dye, and a pale orange fluorescence on the ruff and dress indicate  the presence of lead white. Some zinc-based retouching, appearing bright green under UV light, is evident on the ruff. Silver, now tarnished to black, was used for the black line pattern on the sleeve.","monogram":null,"dimensions_unframed_width":"35.5","dimensions_unframed_height":"43","pigments_background":"Red
