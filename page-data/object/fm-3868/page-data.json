She has long been considered a ‘typical’ example of this artist's work.","description_physical":"The ultraviolet (UV) image of this work shows that numerous areas have been retouched. These include portions of her hat and black costume, which display a greenish fluorescence under UV illumination, indicative of the presence of modern pigments, such as zinc white (as confirmed by additional X-ray fluorescence [XRF] analysis). Extensive repainting can also be identified throughout the white passages of the costume.\n\nThe white overpainting appears to be covering dull grey (original) paint, whose muted colour must have been the reason for the extensive intervention. This grey pigment has been identified as calomel, which was probably white initially, but exposure to light or possibly alkali turned it grey, thus making necessary the extensive repainting.","monogram":false,"dimensions_unframed_width":"41","dimensions_unframed_height":"52","pigments_background":"Azurite (retouch: ultramarine, zinc white)","pigments_costume":"Dress: bone
