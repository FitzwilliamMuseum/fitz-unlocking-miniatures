The infrared image shows some colour losses in the blue background, which appear white due to the parchment showing through. Blue and green areas appear dark under IR radiation, suggesting the use of copper-based pigments.\nThe UV image highlights the colour losses in the blue background and through the foliage, and at the left side as well. The white areas showing an orange UV fluorescence are likely painted with lead white, whereas pink paint passages, like Juno's drapery, display a pinkish UV fluorescence typically due to the use of red organic dyes.\n\nThe yellow flag around Minerva is painted with different pigments, and differences between the upper and lower portions are evident in the UV and X-ray images. It is unclear if it is a pentimento.","monogram":null,"dimensions_unframed_width":"~ 93","dimensions_unframed_height":"~ 68","pigments_background":"Sky: ultramarine blue; landscape: brochantite,
