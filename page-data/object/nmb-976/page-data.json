Areas with a yellow-green UV fluorescence, such as the pearls and portions of the ruff, are retouched with zinc white. Orange parts are lead white retouchings?? \nThe red background has a reddish UV fluorescence, characterisc of red lakes. \nGreen and blue areas appear dark in the NIR image, suggesting the use of copper-based pigments. The shaded area of the ruff is also dark to the NIR radiation, likely due to the use of carbon black to shade the portion.\nThe x-ray highlights the use of metals and lead-based pigments (lead white and red lead), which appear bright in the image. The flesh tones are painted with only a small amount of lead white.","monogram":null,"dimensions_unframed_width":"40","dimensions_unframed_height":"53","pigments_background":"(Insect-based) red
