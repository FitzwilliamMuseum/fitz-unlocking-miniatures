Under UV, the miniature seems to be in a good state of preservation, with some colour losses around the border, which appear bright white due to the fluorescence of the parchment. The orange UV fluorescence displayed by the collar suggests the use of lead white in this area, whereas the pinkish colour of the lips indicates the presence of a red organic dye.\nThe blue background appears dark in the NIR image, due to the use of a copper-based pigment (azurite), as well as the black doublet and hat due to the presence of carbon-based black pigments. A faint hatching is evident around the border of the background, likely made with a different blue pigment.\nThe flesh tones are painted with a small amount of lead white, as evident in the x-ray image because they appear dark. The doublet and hat also appear dark, but the modelling with lead white is evident in the doublet, which appear moderately grey.","monogram":true,"dimensions_unframed_width":"45","dimensions_unframed_height":"55","pigments_background":"Azurite, ultramarine (shading)","pigments_costume":"Black doublet: bone black, lead
