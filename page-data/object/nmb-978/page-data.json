The red background and pink lips show a reddish UV fluorescence, indicating the use of red lakes. White areas that appear orange under UV, such as the collar and eyes, are painted with lead white.\nBlue and green areas appear dark in the NIR region, suggesting the presence of copper-based pigments. The shading part of the collar also appears dark, indicating the use of carbon black to make this area grey.\nThe x-ray image highlights the use of heavy elements, such as lead, that appear brighter. A round shape painted with an heavy element, identified with XRF as mercury, is also evident at the centre of the miniature, but it belongs to the playing card used as support. The flesh tones and hair appear painted with a very small amount of lead-based pigments.\nThe vermilion distribution linked to the playing card could suggest that a figure card was used.","monogram":null,"dimensions_unframed_width":"43","dimensions_unframed_height":"53","pigments_background":"(Insect-based) red organic dye","pigments_costume":"White and green doublet: lead
