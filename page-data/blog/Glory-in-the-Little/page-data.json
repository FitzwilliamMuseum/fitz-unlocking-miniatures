The prestige of Timuriya artistry and, by extension, the very credibility of the wealthiest monarch in the world were on the line: could the Timuriyas actually surpass Britain in the art of ‘limning’ or miniature-painting? The British ambassador to India, Sir Thomas Roe, had made the boastful claim that a ‘Pikture of a frend of myne’ in his possession would surpass in beauty, grace, form, and arrangement any miniature produced by an Indian artist <sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a></sup>. <a href=\"id2\">2</a></p>\n<p>The claim had a precipitous effect and an affronted Jahangir immediately summoned his ‘Cheefe Paynter’ along with four of his greatest court-artists. A few days later – so we are informed by Roe’s detailed journals – six identical miniatures were placed before Roe. Five were Indian reproductions and one was Roe’s original – the Isaac Oliver miniature on which he had placed his wager. His challenge was to find, by candlelight, this miniature from amongst Jahangir’s copies.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1280px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7287005626140ea402086219edc37285/81fa7/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 82.8125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"FIGURE 1\"\n        title=\"FIGURE 1\"\n        src=\"/static/7287005626140ea402086219edc37285/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7287005626140ea402086219edc37285/cb69c/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.1.jpg 320w,\n/static/7287005626140ea402086219edc37285/c08c5/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.1.jpg 640w,\n/static/7287005626140ea402086219edc37285/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.1.jpg 1280w,\n/static/7287005626140ea402086219edc37285/0f98f/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.1.jpg 1920w,\n/static/7287005626140ea402086219edc37285/81fa7/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.1.jpg 2284w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>Fig.1. Bichitr, Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings, 1615-18 (detail), Freer Gallery of Art (F1942.15a).</em> Note the self-portrait of Bichitr (holding a self-portrait) in the bottom left corner. Above him, James I of England after a John de Critz portrait is depicted.</p>\n<p>In his accounts, Thomas Roe repeatedly reduces India to a kind of seductive heathendom – extravagant in its debauchery, fuelled by an alcoholic king’s drunken hospitality, and somehow also the centre of the world. This, he states in a letter addressed to King James I dated 29 January, 1615: “it cannot be denied that this King is one of the mightiest Princes in Asia, as well in extent of territory as in revenue; equall to the Turke, far exceeding the Persian.”<a href=\"%5B2%5D\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>Like other merchants and diplomats from Europe, Roe had arrived at Surat in 1615 in the hopes of obtaining formal agreements for untaxed, bilateral trade between Britain and ‘Indya’ and, on a personal level, to make a name for himself. Yet, he was doomed to fail at this overly ambitious goal for his country, since, for the Timuriyas, it was only a meagre province on the wrong side of the world, and they did not regard it with much respect. King James I was eager to tap into the renowned stores of textiles, gold, semi-precious stones, spices and ‘Curiosityes’ that this exotic land could offer. Britain, however, had nothing desirable or rare enough amongst its exports to appeal to the already spectacularly wealthy India. In such a disadvantageous situation, the ambassador found himself resorting to provocation and cajolery to get Jahangir’s attention and the account of the incident concerning the limned picture of his female acquaintance should be understood in this context.</p>\n<p>As curious Indian courtiers craned their necks to catch a glimpse of the six miniatures, Thomas Roe proceeded to study each one carefully. Initially, he hesitated; which was Isaac Oliver’s unmistakable masterpiece and which the Indian facsimile? But soon enough, the Englishman picked out his miniature and won the bet, later calling Jahangir’s chief painter “a foole” for thinking he could equal European talent.<a href=\"%5B3%5D\">[3]</a></p>\n<p>Today, it is evident that Roe regarded India and Europe – with Britain at its heart – as two antithetical forces in perennial conflict. India was not even a civilisation in his estimation, no matter how wealthy or well-connected it was. Britain, in Roe and his countrymen’s view, though unable to counter India’s hold on the global exchange of commercial artefacts, was nobly humble and moral, and thus superior to India through Christian virtuousness.<a href=\"%5B4%5D\">[4]</a>,<a href=\"%5B5%5D\">[5]</a> Contrary to Roe’s inimical stance which positioned India and Britain as discordant poles, the developments that the British and Timuriya schools of art underwent during this period demonstrate a heightened sensitivity within both to the aesthetic expressions of ‘other’ contemporary traditions. For example, the frequent representation of chubby, playful putti and Mariological crowns in Timuriya court paintings to evoke divinity, and the recurring depiction of vibrant and swirling Persianate flora in Tudor paintings, were the result of increasing globalisation in the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries.<a href=\"%5B6%5D\">[6]</a>,<a href=\"%5B7%5D\">[7]</a> The art of ‘limning’, as the Tudors and Stuarts called it, is an especially potent example of this indirect artistic cross-pollination, through the use of comparable media and methods to achieve the intensely colourful, matt surfaces of these minute depictions. Even though the miniatures of India and those of Britain receive special attention in each their own right, they are generally studied independently of each other.</p>\n<p>However, here, I would like to bring to the forefront two remarkable women of the early 17<sup>th</sup> century – both queens and patrons of innovative artists, whose skills at portraiture in miniature they wielded to create a visual expression of their politically charged personages: Nur Jahan (1573-1645), the empress of India and Jahangir’s most beloved wife, and Anne of Denmark (1574-1619), the queen-consort of James I.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1280px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5192479194d1fa879b64280878b77369/91094/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.2%263.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"FIGURE 2-3\"\n        title=\"FIGURE 2-3\"\n        src=\"/static/5192479194d1fa879b64280878b77369/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.2%263.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5192479194d1fa879b64280878b77369/cb69c/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.2%263.jpg 320w,\n/static/5192479194d1fa879b64280878b77369/c08c5/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.2%263.jpg 640w,\n/static/5192479194d1fa879b64280878b77369/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.2%263.jpg 1280w,\n/static/5192479194d1fa879b64280878b77369/91094/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.2%263.jpg 1801w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>Fig.2 (left).

(See more images of this miniature <a href=\"https://unlocking-miniatures.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/object/rcin-420025\">here</a>)</em></p>\n<p>While Jahangir remained constantly in the throes of an addiction to opium and alcohol, James I’s ineptitude in leading the Protestant English court was apparent from the onset. Jahangir lost the rich, fertile lands of the Punjab and Kandahar to Safavid rivals and James I’s alliance with Catholic Spain had resulted in country-wide resentment. It was within this context that their queens consolidated personal regal autonomy to a surprising extent.</p>\n<p>As the daughter of Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, a German princess and the Queen of Denmark and Norway, Anne of Denmark was intensely aware of her noble lineage. The miniatures she commissioned clearly state this. Isaac Oliver, with his much more Continental style, was her chosen miniaturist over Nicholas Hilliard, who was instead favoured by her husband, James I, as he had been by Elizabeth I. In a particularly striking example in the Royal Collection Trust (fig.6),<a href=\"%5B8%5D\">[8]</a> we see a diamond-studded ‘S’ jewel prominently placed on Anne’s ruff, and a ‘C’ enveloping the number 4. The letters of the alphabet doubtlessly represent her mother, Queen Sophie, and brother, King Christian IV. The message is clear: she is not merely an appendage to James I; this is a queen proudly proclaiming her continental lineage.</p>\n<p>Nur Jahan, on the other hand, was born a commoner. Mehr-un-Nissa or ‘beguiling woman’ was her actual name (fig.2). Her father, Mirza Ghiyas Beg, was an Iranian refugee at Agra. Noor Jahan’s is a tale coloured by controversy and one breaking with tradition. Although thirty-four years old and estranged from her first husband when she first met Jahangir, the legend goes that the emperor fell madly in love with the Iranian merchant selling her wares in the Meena Bazaar (the annual women’s market). Right until Jahangir’s death, Nur Jahan’s influence depended entirely on the status she had gained through her royal marriage; through history she comes down to us as his twentieth and most influential wife, but it is only now that the extent of her power in the empire and over its Timuriya leader has been fully recognised.<a href=\"%5B9%5D\">[9]</a></p>\n<p>Deeply conscious of the anonymity of her birth as well as of her Iranian roots – which were seen by many to be a sign of disloyalty since Safavid Iran was an age-old rival of the Timuriyas – Nur Jahan made the utmost of her position as favourite consort. Through her artistic patronage, she worked hard to build her public image as one possessing authority. Jahangir’s chronic inebriation, combined with his love of botany, zoology and his connoisseurship of painting and music, meant that delights of the soul were given more attention than the necessities of business, military defence and diplomacy. This negligence provided an opportunity for his ambitious queen to command the empire.</p>\n<p>At the apex of her supremacy, Nur Jahan was consigning assignments to Timuriya ships, issuing ‘firmans’ or imperial edicts in her own seal, signing commercial treaties with international diplomats, leading hunting expeditions on holidays and amassing lucrative properties in her name. The emperor of India was inert, his throne alive only in paintings, and his true heir-apparent, Prince Khurram, was duly banished to the Deccan, i.e. southern India, in order to remove the potential threat he embodied.<a href=\"%5B10%5D\">[10]</a></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1280px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3a83c639a11648d3eb18b79db1b85abd/af3b8/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.4%265.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"FIGURE 4-5\"\n        title=\"FIGURE 4-5\"\n        src=\"/static/3a83c639a11648d3eb18b79db1b85abd/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.4%265.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3a83c639a11648d3eb18b79db1b85abd/cb69c/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.4%265.jpg 320w,\n/static/3a83c639a11648d3eb18b79db1b85abd/c08c5/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.4%265.jpg 640w,\n/static/3a83c639a11648d3eb18b79db1b85abd/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.4%265.jpg 1280w,\n/static/3a83c639a11648d3eb18b79db1b85abd/af3b8/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.4%265.jpg 1890w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>Fig.4 (left).

(OA 3676 B Recto ; OA 3676 b).©2016 RMN-Grand Palais (musée du Louvre) / Mathieu Rabeau</em></p>\n<p>An Indian ‘miniature’ in the Cleveland Museum of Art encapsulates this authority-shift (fig.4).<a href=\"%5B11%5D\">[11]</a> In it, we view a lone Nur Jahan. She stands barefoot. There is neither marble nor sand underneath her delicate feet clad with ‘ghungroo’, or dancing bells, round her ankles. In her elegant hands rests the portrait of a powder-faced Jahangir. His whitened moustache is a declaration of old age, the torpor of submission to death. Nur Jahan’s neck is draped in loop upon loop of pearls, symbolising youth and royalty. The dupatta that covers her torso for modesty (perhaps made of Dakkai muslin – the finest in the world – much of whose trade she supervised) is enticingly translucent, while her small lips, sharp nose and lotus-eyes are framed by jet black ringlets of hair. She exudes ethereal youth and beauty while gazing reverently at Jahangir’s visage. But his entire person is contained between her two hands and <em>she</em> is the future of the Timuriya House.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to separate politics from art when it comes to Nur Jahan. This portrait borrows directly from an earlier one of Jahangir, within which he too held his dying father’s image to indicate his right to the throne (fig.5). Nur Jahan’s portrait was completed in 1627, by which time Jahangir needed ever-increasing doses of opium to carry out his daily-tasks, even suffering from withdrawal symptoms like shivering when he resisted the drug. The time is thus perfect to portray the queen’s own ‘right’ to inherit the throne by casting herself in the role of Jahangir’s successor to the throne. Much like her overseas counterpart, Nur Jahan was fascinated by the power that art could symbolically signify.<a href=\"%5B12%5D\">[12]</a></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1280px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/15b38/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 127.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"FIGURE 6\"\n        title=\"FIGURE 6\"\n        src=\"/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/cb69c/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg 320w,\n/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/c08c5/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg 640w,\n/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg 1280w,\n/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/0f98f/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg 1920w,\n/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/8ec0a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg 2560w,\n/static/af97ec0498962c7bda7a52ae12368889/15b38/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_fig.6.jpg 4111w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>Fig.6.

Since these limned portraits were bestowed upon court-favourites, the acceptance of this new trend was not to be questioned. The receiver could only praise that which was presented.<a href=\"%5B14%5D\">[14]</a> This contrasts with Nur Jahan’s depictions, who prized eternal youth in a bid for legitimacy and longevity not dissimilar to that of Queen Elizabeth I of England in her mask of youth as ‘the Virgin Queen’, expressed in numerous portraits of her late reign.<a href=\"%5B15%5D\">[15]</a></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1280px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cb7a4432df2c5414a4b6d8cd9159e517/53ff1/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.7%268.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 70.9375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"FIGURE 7-8\"\n        title=\"FIGURE 7-8\"\n        src=\"/static/cb7a4432df2c5414a4b6d8cd9159e517/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.7%268.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cb7a4432df2c5414a4b6d8cd9159e517/cb69c/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.7%268.jpg 320w,\n/static/cb7a4432df2c5414a4b6d8cd9159e517/c08c5/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.7%268.jpg 640w,\n/static/cb7a4432df2c5414a4b6d8cd9159e517/eea4a/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.7%268.jpg 1280w,\n/static/cb7a4432df2c5414a4b6d8cd9159e517/53ff1/Avishi_NurJahan_blogpost_figs.7%268.jpg 1824w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>Fig.7 (left). Abul-Hasan Nasiruz Zaman, Nur Jahan holding a gun, 17th century, ©Rampur Raza Library</em></p>\n<p><em>Fig.8 (right). Paul van Somer, Anne of Denmark and a groom, 1617, ©Royal Collection Trust (RCIN 405887)</em></p>\n<p>There is, however, much in common between the two queens’ understanding of the potency of art. In the Rampur Raza Library resides an astonishing miniature called ‘Nur Jahan Holding a Gun’ (fig.7). We see that the queen has tied her hair and tucked it completely inside a turban. In Jahangir’s style, she wears baloony ‘pyjamas’ and, unlike in the previous portrait, her jewels recede into a kind of insignificance. The focus of this picture is not youth as expressed by lithe beauty. Rather, she shows herself to possess manliness and extreme confidence. She proudly displays her musket, which travels the entire length of the composition. Her gaze is turned upwards in a fearless gestures. She seems to contemplate the best strategy to tackle any rival, treating them as nothing more than a trembling target. After all, legends of the queen’s expertise as a shooter and hunter abounded in Timurid India. Once, she slayed four tigers with only six bullets. Such unabashed pride at her own mastery at a masculine sport seems to be the subject of this portrait.<a href=\"%5B16%5D\">[16]</a></p>\n<p>We find a parallel in Paul van Somer’s 1617 large-scale portrait of Anne of Denmark in hunting costume surrounded by her dogs (fig.8).<a href=\"%5B17%5D\">[17]</a> Framed, it measures 287.5 by 231cm; the scale of this portrait speaks to its theme. Anne of Denmark, in three-quarter profile, is looking right at us with an assertive gaze. The deep teal sky seems to rumble as clouds crowd behind her. She wears practical leather-gloves meant for hunting and riding, as if they were an ornament unto themselves and indeed, they are turned into ornaments of ability and control; they are much more significant than a display of delicately draped pearls accentuating her femininity and wealth. Her right arm rests on her waist with her elbow jutting out in a gesture more commonly adopted by men, while she handles the leash controlling her five greyhounds with her left. Some of her dogs are unleashed but still crowding around her looking up at her adoringly in their collars emblazoned with her initials ‘AR’ (Anne Regina). A groom of African descent, who notably wears the livery of her mother’s House of Oldenburg and not of the House of Stuart, gazes at her from behind her horse’s head, enthralled. An owl – the symbol of wisdom associated with Athena – is perched on a branch in the distance. A scroll bearing the inscription, ‘LA MIA GRANDEZZA DAL ECCELSO’ ('My greatness is from on high'), floats directly above the queen’s head. Her husband and children are entirely absent from the scene and shows her to be in possession of power, wealth and control granted not solely through the position afforded to her by her husband, but through divine grace and her own illustrious lineage.</p>\n<p>In this post, I have made a comparison between two remarkable females who lived at more or less opposite ends of the known world in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century. And yet, I have attempted to draw out the striking similarities between them, in the way that they both pushed the boundaries of female power in each of their individual circumstances. In particular, I have illustrated how their patronage of talented artists, and the way in which they had those artists express idealised versions of themselves as wielding independent power to rival their royal husbands in a strongly male-dominated society, in many ways unites them in spite of their considerable cultural differences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>REFERENCES</h2>\n<p><sup id=\"fn1\">1.
