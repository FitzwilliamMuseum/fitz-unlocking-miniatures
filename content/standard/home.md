      <p>Portrait miniatures were important signs of wealth and status in Elizabethan and Stuart England and often carried highly personal, symbolic meaning to their owners. Made to fit within the palm of a hand, and often set within lockets adorned with precious stones and enamel detailing, English portrait miniatures need protection from the damaging effects of handling, light and moisture. Today, they are typically displayed within dimly lit display cases in museums, and the extraordinary detail and exquisite artistry of miniatures is therefore hard to appreciate.</p>
      <p>This resource offers the opportunity to study a large number of miniature portraits of men and women of a previous age in greater detail than has ever before been possible. Unlock for yourself centuries old secrets surrounding the sitters, the artists, the materials used and more.</p>
